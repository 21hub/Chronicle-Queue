== Chronicle Queue

Inter Process Communication ( IPC ) with sub micro-second latency and able to store every message.

image::http://chronicle.software/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ChronicleQueue_200px.png[]

Publishing 40 bytes messages, we achieve under 1 micro-seconds latencies a high percentage of the time.
The 99%ile latency is the worst 1 in 100, and the 99.9%ile is the worst 1 in 1000 latency.

.Latency to send/receive on the same machine.
|=======
| Batch Size | 10 million events per minute | 60 million events per minute | 100 million events per minute
| 99%ile | 0.78 &micro;s | 0.78 &micro;s | 1.2 &micro;s
| 99.9%ile | 1.2 &micro;s | 1.3 &micro;s | 1.5 &micro;s
|=======

.Latency to send/receive on a second machine.
|=======
| Batch Size | 10 million events per minute | 60 million events per minute | 100 million events per minute
| 99%ile | 20 &micro;s | 28 &micro;s | 176 &micro;s
| 99.9%ile | 901 &micro;s | 705 &micro;s | 5,370 &micro;s
|=======

NOTE: 100 million events per minute is sending an event every 660 nano-seconds, replicated and persisted.

IMPORTANT: This is not using a *large cluster of machines*, this is using one thread to publish and one thread to consume.

=== Overview

Chronicle Queue is a Java project focused on building a persisted low latency messaging framework for high performance and critical applications.

image::http://chronicle.software/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Chronicle-diagram_005.jpg[]

At first glance Chronicle Queue can be seen as **yet another queue implementation** but it has major design choices that should be emphasised.

Using non-heap storage options (RandomAccessFile) Queue provides a processing environment where applications do not suffer from Garbage Collection. While implementing high performance and memory-intensive applications (you heard the fancy term "bigdata"?) in Java; one of the biggest problems is Garbage Collection. Garbage Collection (GC) may slow down your critical operations non-deterministically at any time. In order to avoid non-determinism and escape from GC delays off-heap memory solutions are ideal. The main idea is to manage your memory manually so it does not suffer from GC. Chronicle behaves like a management interface over off-heap memory so you can build your own solutions over it.
Queue uses RandomAccessFiles while managing memory and this choice brings lots of possibilities. RandomAccessFiles permit non-sequential, or random, access to a file's contents. To access a file randomly, you open the file, seek a particular location, and read from or write to that file. RandomAccessFiles can be seen as "large" C-type byte arrays that you can access at any random index "directly" using pointers. File portions can be used as ByteBuffers if the portion is mapped into memory.

This memory mapped file is also used for exceptionally fast interprocess communication (IPC) without affecting your system performance. There is no Garbage Collection (GC) as everything is done off heap.

=== High level interface

Chronicle v4.4+ supports the use of proxies to send and consume messages.  You start by defining an asynchronous `interface` where all methods have;

- arguments which are only inputs.
- no return value or exceptions expected.

.A simple asynchronous interface
[source, Java]
----
interface MessageListener {
    void method1(Message1 message);

    void method2(Message2 message);
}

static class Message1 extends AbstractMarshallable {
    String text;

    public Message1(String text) {
        this.text = text;
    }
}

static class Message2 extends AbstractMarshallable {
    long number;

    public Message2(long number) {
        this.number = number;
    }
}
----

To write to the queue you can call a proxy which implements this interface

[source, Java]
----
SingleChronicleQueue queue1 = SingleChronicleQueueBuilder.binary(path).build();

MessageListener writer1 = queue1.acquireAppender().methodWriter(MessageListener.class);

// call method on the interface to send messages
writer1.method1(new Message1("hello"));
writer1.method2(new Message2(234));
-----

These call produce message which can be dumped as

[source, YAML]
----
# position: 262568, header: 0
--- !!data #binary
method1: {
  text: hello
}
# position: 262597, header: 1
--- !!data #binary
method2: {
  number: !int 234
}
----

To read the messages you can provide a reader which calls you implementation with the same calls you made.

[source, Java]
----
// a proxy which print each method called on it
MessageListener processor = ObjectUtils.printAll(MessageListener.class)
// a queue reader which turns messages into method calls.
MethodReader reader2 = queue1.createTailer().methodReader(processor);

assertTrue(reader1.readOne());
assertTrue(reader1.readOne());
assertFalse(reader1.readOne());
----

Running this example prints

[source]
----
method1 [!Message1 {
  text: hello
}
]
method2 [!Message2 {
  number: 234
}
]
-----

=== Building Blocks

Chronicle Queue is the main interface for management and can be seen as the Collection class of Chronicle environment. You will reserve a portion of memory and then put/fetch/update records using the Chronicle interface.

Chronicle has three main concepts:

  * Tailer (sequential and random reads, forward and backwards)
  * Appender (sequential writes, append to the end only).

An Excerpt is the main data container in a Chronicle Queue, each Chronicle is composed of Excerpts. Putting data to a chronicle means starting a new Excerpt, writing data into it and finishing the Excerpt at the end.
A Tailer is an Excerpt optimized for sequential reads.
An Appender is something like Iterator in Chronicle environment. You add data appending the current chronicle.

=== Chronicle Queue V4

Current version of Chronicle-Queue (V4) contains the SingleChronicleQueue implementation.

==== Single Chronicle Queue

This queue is a designed to support:
 - rolling files on a daily, weekly or hourly basis.
 - concurrent writers on the same machine.
 - concurrent readers on the same machine or across multiple machines via TCP replication (With Chronicle Queue Enterprise).
 - zero copy serialization and deserialization.
 - millions of writes/reads per second on commodity hardware. <br/>(~5 M messages / second for 96 byte messages on a i7-4790)

The directory structure is as follows.

[source]
----
base-directory /
   {cycle-name}.cq4       - The default format is yyyyMMdd for daily rolling.
----

The format consists of Size Prefixed Bytes which are formatted using BinaryWire or TextWire.  The ChronicleQueue.dump() method can be used to dump the raw contents as a String.

=== Getting Started

==== Chronicle Construction
Creating an instance of Chronicle is a little more complex than just calling a constructor.
To create an instance you have to use the ChronicleQueueBuilder.

[source, Java]
----
String basePath = System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir") + "/getting-started"
ChronicleQueue queue = ChronicleQueueBuilder.single("queue-dir").build();
----

In this example we have created an IndexedChronicle which creates two RandomAccessFiles one for indexes and one for data having names relatively:

${java.io.tmpdir}/getting-started/{today}.cq4

==== Writing

[source, Java]
----
// Obtain an ExcerptAppender
ExcerptAppender appender = queue.acquireAppender();

// write - {msg: TestMessage}
appender.writeDocument(w -> w.write(() -> "msg").text("TestMessage"));

// write - TestMessage
appender.writeText("TestMessage");
----

==== Reading

[source, Java]
----
ExcerptTailer tailer = queue.createTailer();

tailer.readDocument(w -> System.out.println("msg: " + w.read(()->"msg").text()));

assertEquals("TestMessage", tailer.readText());
----

==== Cleanup

Chronicle Queue stores its data off heap and it is recommended that you call close() 
once you have finished working with Chronicle-Queue to free resources,

NOTE: no data will be lost of you don't do this, this is only to clean resources used.

[source, Java]
----
queue.close();
----

==== Putting it all together

[source, Java]
----
try (ChronicleQueue queue = ChronicleQueueBuilder.single("queue-dir").build()) {
    // Obtain an ExcerptAppender
    ExcerptAppender appender = queue.acquireAppender();

    // write - {msg: TestMessage}
    appender.writeDocument(w -> w.write(() -> "msg").text("TestMessage"));

    // write - TestMessage
    appender.writeText("TestMessage");

    ExcerptTailer tailer = queue.createTailer();

    tailer.readDocument(w -> System.out.println("msg: " + w.read(()->"msg").text()));

    assertEquals("TestMessage", tailer.readText());
}
----

=== Replication

Chronicle Queue Enterprise supports TCP replication with optional filtering so only the required record or even fields are transmitted. This improves performances and reduce bandwitdh requirements.
