Vanilla Chronicle
============

 Vanilla Chronicle is a designed for more features rather than just speed. It it is fast enough, it should be easier to use/manage.  It supports

 - rolling files on a daily, weekly or hourly basis.
 - concurrent writers on the same machine.
 - concurrent readers on the same machine or across multiple machines via TCP replication.
 - zero copy serialization and deserialization.
 - one million writes/reads per second on commodity hardware.
 - persistence as required.
 - reader on source can wait for replication. i.e. source reader sees excerpts after replication acknowledge.
 - data files have more information for rebuilding indexes.
